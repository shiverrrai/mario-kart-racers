A twist on Mario Kart, built using Pygame. The 
player's goal is to beat the AI-driven car by completing three laps around the 
track in the shortest time possible. To liken the game to Mario Kart, there are
also bananas scattered across the track, which slow the player down if rolled 
over. 

To run this game, the only additional library required is Pygame. Pygame can
be freely downloaded from this site: http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml. For 
Windows, simply follow the directions on screen to install. For Macs, also 
follow the on-screen instructions, but be sure you are using the 32-bit version
of Python.
