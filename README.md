# Mario Kart Racers
A twist on Mario Kart, built using Pygame. The 
player's goal is to beat the AI-driven car by completing three laps around the 
track in the shortest time possible. To liken the game to Mario Kart, there are
also bananas scattered across the track, which slow the player down if rolled 
over. See if you can win!

## Dependencies

pip install pygame
